= Description
  A custom expand_path method for Ruby on Windows that doesn't suck.

= The Plan
  The initial implementation will use FFI as a prototype. Once that is
  working and passing all tests, I will convert it to a C extension.

= Things Making It Difficult
  * The taint rules
  * The $DATA handling
  * Drive-current handling
