= Description
  A custom expand_path method for Ruby on Windows that doesn't suck.

= The Plan
  The initial implementation will use FFI as a prototype. Once that is
  working and passing all tests, I will convert it to a C extension.

= Things Making It Difficult
  - The taint rules
  - The $DATA handling
  - Drive-current handling
  - The '~' handling

= Specifics On Tilde Handling
  - A '~' by itself is expanded to ENV['HOME'].
  - If the '~' is immediately followed by any non-path separator character
    results in an ArgumentError.
  - If the '~' is preceded by any character, it is treated literally.
  - Any attempt to interpolate '~' if ENV['HOME'] isn't set will result in
    an ArgumentError.

  In short, the '~' character on Windows, unlike Unix, does not allow for user
  expansion. This could be made to work, though with some difficulty.

  Personal thoughts: I've never liked tilde expansion in this method, even on
  Unix, because it's SHELL behavior, not something the OS impelements. I realize
  the core developers were trying to be helpful, but here it's just a pain due
  to parsing.
