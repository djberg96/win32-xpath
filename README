= Description
  A custom File.expand_path method for Ruby on Windows that's much
  faster and works better.

= Installation
  gem install win32-xpath

= Synopsis
  require 'win32/xpath'

  # That's it, you are now using this library when you call File.expand_path

= Features
  * A 5x average performance boost over MRI's current method.
  * Support for ~user expansion.

= Known Issues
  * This library does not support drive-current paths for the 2nd argument.
  * This library does not support alt-stream name autocorrection.

  It is very unlikely you will ever be affected by either of these things.
  Drive-current paths are a relic of DOS 1.0, but even so this library
  will handle them in the first argument.

  I don't support alt-stream mangling because I don't believe it's the
  job of this method to peform autocorrection. Even in MRI it only works
  for the default $DATA stream, and then only for a certain type of
  syntax error. I do not know when or why it was added.

  page at https://github.com/djberg96/win32-xpath.
